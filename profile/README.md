## Hay Hair Healthy
Hair Healthy (Hay) is an application designed to overcome various hair damage problems that many Indonesian people experience, such as hair loss, dandruff and damage due to mechanical, chemical and environmental factors.

## Background
According to a survey conducted by the Jakpat application, many people in Indonesia suffer from hair damage. The survey reveals that 64.7% of the population experience hair loss, 44.3% have dandruff, and 30.8% have dry and dull hair. This is mainly due to the lack of awareness about hair health among the Indonesian population, along with the hot climate in Indonesia which leads to dryness and dullness of hair. Additionally, mismatches between hair type and the products used also contribute to the problem.

The Hay (Hair Healthy) application is expected to help maintain healthy hair by diagnosing hair problems through image classification. By identifying hair problems, this app can provide appropriate hair product recommendations, thus helping people to maintain their hair health.
